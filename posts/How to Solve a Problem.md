If there's one thing university has taught me, it's that you're gonna run through a lot of problems. I don't just mean relationship problems, I mean everything. The best way to maximise your washing whilst minimising cost; that's a problem. Deciding what time to leave to get to your lecture at a specific time so you can decide who to sit next to; that's a problem. Figuring out the best way to stuff things into the vegetable drawer so that it actually closes; that's a problem, a very hard one at that.
