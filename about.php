                        <p>
                            I'm Brandon Okeke. I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Kent, currently in my second year. If you're looking for my CV, it's a good thing I've got a PDF version avialable right <a href="content/cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I never know what to write here so if you figure that out, let me know!

                        <h2>The Blog</h2>
                        <p>
                            This blog is just a space for me to write my opinions on topics I have, well opinions about. Mostly I'll be writing about the experiences I've had studying Computer Science, my views on the technology industry as a whole and my experiences dealing with mental health conditions. My secret aim is to write a post that day gets referenced in someone's work one day!

                            Technically, this blog has been hand coded using HTML, CSS and PHP. Posts are saved in a MySQL databse and all posts content is generated dynamically. If you're interested in how the site is coded then you can check it out on my GitHub.
